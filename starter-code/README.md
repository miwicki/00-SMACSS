##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Going off of the readings, I determined that:
1) the base.css file should house all of the font styles, coloring, text alignments for each individual piece.
2) the layout.css file should include all of the layout portions for each individual piece, including the height, width, padding, margin, border, and floats.
3) the modules.css file should have individual links/references within individual elements within the code.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Not really, I wasn't sure how to change it to make it any better/readable
